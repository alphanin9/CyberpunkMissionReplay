### Mission Replay for Cyberpunk 2077

This project is currently in development and is not ready for usage. Current capabilities include:

- Starting a new session from ingame (start new game or start from save), while preserving character customization state
- Quest to native communication via FactsDBManagerNodeDefinition hook

End goal is to be able to replay a pre-prepared mission starting from an ingame menu while preserving character customization, progression and inventory.

The project uses [RED4ext.SDK](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK) and [RedLib](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-red-lib).
